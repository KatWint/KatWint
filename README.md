Hello 
My name is Kathryn but preferably go by Kat. 
I am an aspiring Instructional Designer currently working as a special education teacher in the elementary school setting. 
With the transition that took place to accommodate the pandemic, students were faced with tasks online that are not as easy
to navigate as they get younger. With that, those with special needs have an even harder time when accommodations they are given 
in the classroom have not transitioned as well to the online world. I want to assist in making their educational journey
as beneficial online as it can be in person. Several teachers and parents reported that there were students who benefited
from the online instruction. I want to make it so that online can remain a beneficial option for all students, including those who
may need assistance but have yet to be identified.
