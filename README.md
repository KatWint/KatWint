Hello 
My name is Kathryn but preferably go by Kat. 
I am  Software Engineer with a special interest in front end development. 
My background has been centered on working directly with people to provide support
and assist with creating a more inclusive space. As technology as grown, the accessibility
aspect has not kept up at the same pace. I want to assist in creating an inclusive technological
space for both personal and professional use by all individuals.
